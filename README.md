# CRUD-APP
CRUD Operation in Node.js using MongoDB as a database and Express.js as a framework.

For update and delete operation enter the "_id" of the person that is stored in the database.

Instead of entering "_id" that is uniquely generated for each user we can also use autoincrement sequence in MongoDB .I will use it later.
